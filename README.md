# DocAI

A GPT-3 powered documentation search engine.

## How it works

DocAI runs by scraping your documentation from your repositories and then using that data to fine-tune a GPT-3 model that your users can use to search through your documentation.

## Usage

You can use DocAI freely without any attribution required, keep in mind that you will need to pay for GPT-3 model usage (both fine-tuning and completions).

## Setup

First you'll need to grab your API key from OpenAI [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) and your Organisation ID [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/org-settings)
